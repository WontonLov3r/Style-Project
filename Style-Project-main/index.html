          <div>
            Charles Schulz (1922-2000) was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the comic strip "Peanuts". He was born in Minnesota and showed an early interest in drawing. Schulz served in the US Army during World War II, and afterwards began his career as a cartoonist.
            
            In 1950, Schulz's "Peanuts" debuted in seven American newspapers. The strip featured beloved characters such as Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and many others. "Peanuts" went on to become one of the most popular and influential comic strips of all time, running for nearly 50 years and appearing in thousands of newspapers around the world.
            
            Schulz's work was known for its gentle humor, insightful observations about childhood and human nature, and its ability to capture the bittersweet moments of life. Schulz was widely admired for his dedication to his craft and his willingness to tackle difficult and controversial topics through his work.
            
            In addition to his work as a cartoonist, Schulz was also an avid ice skater and founded the "Redwood Empire Ice Arena" in California. He was married twice and had five children. Schulz passed away in 2000, leaving behind a legacy of beloved characters and a body of work that continues to inspire and delight audiences around the world

              <p>Charles Schulz's Peanuts art style is distinct and unmistakable, distinguished by its simplicity, clarity, and expressive use of lines.

                Schulz's style was influenced by early comic strips from the 1920s and 1930s, which frequently employed bold, black figures to depict characters and settings. Schulz used a similar method to construct the contours of the characters and their setting, using thick, black lines.
                
                The characters are created in a simplistic, minimalist style, with only a few lines expressing their characteristics and feelings. Schulz employed a wide range of facial expressions and body language to describe his characters' emotions, making them accessible and engaging to readers.
                
                Backgrounds in Peanuts are frequently minimal, with little complexity beyond basic shapes.The emphasis on simplicity directs the reader's attention to the characters and their interactions, which are central to the strip's comedy and tragedy.
                
                Overall, Peanuts' visual style fits the strip's themes of youthful innocence, companionship, and the search for meaning in life well. It had a significant impact on the world of comics and popular culture, and it is still considered a classic to this day.</p>

              <p>After Schulz died in 2000, a designer with the name of Tyler Carter continued his legacy by partnering with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. He designed the new characters from Schulz's Charlie Brown, and used these characters for the movie "The Peanuts Movie" which was later aired in 2015</p>
